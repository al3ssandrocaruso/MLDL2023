This file contains a general description of the project
- action-net
    - ActionNet_test.pkl / ActionNet_train.pkl
        Here we can find .pkl files with annotations related to ActionNet dataset.
        Pickle files can be transformed and read using pandas.
        This is a sample structure of ActionNet_test.pkl:

        labels                    Peel
    - visualize_spec
        Code for obtaining spectrogram of signal (used for EMG in our case).
- configs
    Configuration files used to manage the project
- models
    - init
    - FinalClassifier
    - I3D
    - VideModel
- pretrained_i3d
    Here we can find the .pt files containing the pretrained i3d models for both flow and RGB.
    We will use this files in feature_extractions.py in order to load and run the model and extract the features.
